Bulgaria, as European Union member state, has a classical twelve grades based school educational system. The quality of the education is measured on an annual basis, at the end of the academic year, by pupils exams in fourth, seventh and twelfth grade. Such annual evaluation is related with big amount of paper work and documents exchange. The results of the evaluation should be provided to the authorities in a secure and reliable way. With the modern blockchain technologies a schools based distributed computing environment can be created and many of the current difficulties to be overcome. Each school can support in its IT infrastructure a blockchain based peer. Ministry of Education will be able to access all relevant data in convenient and secure way. The blockchain technology will prevent falsification of pupils results. Reliable information can be provided for interested institutions like universities and potential employers. In this paper possibilities for blockchain technologies implementation are discussed in order Bulgarian school education system to be improved.
